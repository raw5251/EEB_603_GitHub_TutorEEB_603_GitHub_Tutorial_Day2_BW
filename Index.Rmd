## Load the packages
# install.packages('gapminder')

# Base plot
plot(x = gapminder$gdpPercap, y = gapminder$lifeExp)
# The default graph is scatter plot. However, you can
# specify your choice of graph using an argument code
plot(x = gapminder$gdpPercap, y = gapminder$lifeExp, type = "line")
# the code above will produce a line graph.
# You can also use a boxplot to plot your data.
boxplot(gapminder$lifeExp ~ gapminder$continent)
# The syntax '~' above is used for several things. In the
# code above it reads 'Life expentancy 'as determined' by
# Continent'
# It is important to also know that box plot work when one
# of the data type is a categorical data
# We can also make histogram, which is used to see the
# distribution of a data
hist(gapminder$lifeExp, col = "pink")
# Notice in the code above that there is an argument 'col'
# which helps to add color to the graph.
# GGPLOT is much cleaner and better to create graphs for
# publications
# install.packages('ggplot')
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
# The argument 'mapping' helps to create a template where
# our data will be plotted Notice that, the '$' is not used
# to call out the data in a dataset, this is because of the
# 'aes' which tell the computer to look for the vectors
# inside the data 'gapminder' that was written before it.
# The code above doesn't include any graph, it sets the
# stage for the graphs. 'gg' in 'ggplot' stands for
# 'grammar of graphics'. In order to continue to use the
# 'template' we add a '+' sign after the code. This tells
# the computer that everything that will come after should
# be on it.
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +

# geom_points() helps to add scatter plot geom_line helps
# to add line graphs

# HOW TO CREATE A SUBSET FROM A DATA E.G GAPMINDER
# Let's create a new data set that includes all the
# information of America in gapmider
americas <- gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Americas", ]
# Important notice are the use of double equal to sign.
# Also, the comma at the end of 'Americas' was added to
# tell the computer that we need all the columns in the row
# 'Americas'.

# HOW TO MAKE SMALL MULTIPLES OF DATA
# Using the subset 'americas'
ggplot(data = americas, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_line() + facet_wrap(~country)
# You can see that we have created a subset of life
# expectancy against year in countries in america. One
# thing we should note is that text of the years on x axis
# and the values on y axis are not that clear. We can
# remedy this using the function 'theme'
ggplot(data = americas, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_line() + facet_wrap(~country) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
# Now the years are not overlapping with each other.
# Also, the X and Y axis can be renamed on the graph using
# 'xlab' and 'ylab' functions.
ggplot(data = americas, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_line() + facet_wrap(~country) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +
    xlab("Year")
# Observe that the X-axis has been change from 'year' to
# 'Year'
ggplot(data = americas, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_line() + facet_wrap(~country) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +
    xlab("Year") + ylab("LifeExpectancy")
# Also the y axis has been change from 'lifeExp' to
# 'LifeExpectancy'
# HOW TO SAVE A FIGURE
# You save a figure using the 'ggsave' function.  However,
# before you do that you will have to make the figure into
# an object that will be saved in the environment. Here I
# will make it object 'p' in my environment
p <- ggplot(data = americas, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_line() + facet_wrap(~country) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +
    xlab("Year") + ylab("LifeExpectancy")
# Now I can save it.
ggsave(filename = "./AmericasLifeExp.png", plot = p, width = 20,
    height = 15, dpi = 300, units = "cm")
# Now, it is saved in your project directory. The ggsave
# function will help you meet the specific journal
# requirements for each publication.
